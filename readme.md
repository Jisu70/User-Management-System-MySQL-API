# User Management System with MySQL and Backend API Calling

The User Management System with MySQL and Backend API Calling is a web application that allows users to store and manage user information using MySQL as the database and implement backend API calls for data manipulation.

## Features

- Save user details (name, email, and phone number) to a MySQL database.
- Display user details on the screen.
- Edit user information.
- Delete users from the database.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-management-system.git
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies. (Please refer to the project documentation for specific instructions.)

3. Set up a MySQL database and configure the database connection settings in the project.

4. Launch the application by starting the backend server and opening the front-end application in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Fill out the form with the user's name, email, and phone number.
2. Click the "Save" button to store the user details in the MySQL database using the backend API.
3. The user's details will be displayed on the screen, along with "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.
4. To edit a user's details, click the "Edit" button associated with that user.
5. Make the necessary changes in the provided fields.
6. Click the "Update" button to send the updated user details to the backend API, which will update the user information in the MySQL database.
7. To delete a user, click the "Delete" button associated with that user.
8. A confirmation prompt will appear.
9. Click "OK" to send a delete request to the backend API, which will remove the user's details from the MySQL database.
